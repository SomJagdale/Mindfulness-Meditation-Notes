# Mindfulness-Meditation-Notes

Mindfulness Meditation 
1. Attitude of Openess
2. Attitude of Curiosity
3. Attitude of Non-Judgment

The goal is to become more aware of your 
1. thoughts, 
2. emotions, and 
3. sensations 
as they arise, without getting caught up in them.


Key Elements of Mindfulness Meditation:
Attention to the Present Moment: Focus on the here and now rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.

Observing Without Judgment:
Notice your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations without labeling them as good or bad.

Acceptance:
Accept your experiences as they are, without trying to change or avoid them.

Breath Awareness:
Often involves focusing on the breath as an anchor to return to whenever the mind wanders.


How to Practice Mindfulness Meditation:
Find a Comfortable Position: Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. You can sit on a chair, cushion, or lie down on your back.

Settle and Focus: Close your eyes if comfortable and take a few deep breaths. Allow yourself to settle into the present moment.

Focus on Your Breath: Pay attention to the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. Notice the rise and fall of your chest or the feeling of air passing through your nostrils.

Notice Your Thoughts: As you meditate, you will inevitably become distracted by thoughts. When this happens, simply notice them without judgment and gently bring your focus back to your breath.

Observe Sensations: Pay attention to any bodily sensations, sounds, or other stimuli in your environment. Observe them without reacting.

Practice Non-Judgment: If you find yourself judging or labeling your thoughts or feelings, acknowledge this and return to a non-judgmental awareness.

End the Meditation: After a set period (start with 5-10 minutes and gradually increase), gently bring your awareness back to the room. Open your eyes if they were closed and take a moment to notice how you feel.
